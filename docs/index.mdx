# Getting Started with Fuel to Rise<sup>TM</sup>

Welcome! Whether you are a new user to Rise Nutrition, or a long-time supporter, please use this
documentation to navigate the many different features and aspects of the Rise Nutrition platform.


## Components of the Rise Platform

The Fuel to Rise<sup>TM</sup> platform is comprised of two different components that
provide insight into you and your team's nutrition and training information.
View the different component overviews below, and please dive into the appropriate component's
documentation as desired.

### Team Admin Dashboard

The [Team Web Dashboard](https://app.risenutrition.org/) is our web-accessible dashboard that allows team administrators, coaches, medical staff, and registered dietitians to monitor and interact with all their athletes. It is designed to easily switch between teams for those working with an entire athletic department. You'll see that you can add and edit data, view nutrition status and performance metrics for individual athletes and position groups, set goals and reminders, upload educational materials for teams to access and identify trends in nutrition and performance data.

View the [Team Web Dashboard documentation][dashboard] for more information.

### Athlete Mobile Application

The Athlete Mobile Application is our iPhone- and Android-compatible application that
allows athletes to track and monitor their nutrition and training activities. The app is designed to
be simple, informative, and helpful for athletes to understand how to maximize their performance
without getting lost in the weeds.

View the [Athlete Mobile Application documentation][mobile] for more information.

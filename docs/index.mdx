# Getting Started with Fuel to Rise<sup>TM</sup>

Welcome! Whether you are a new user to Rise Nutrition, or a long-time supporter, please use this
documentation to navigate the many different features and aspects of the Rise Nutrition ecosystem.

## Feedback & Assistance

If you have feedback on our documentation or require extra assistance, please [reach out to us][contact] or
[consider creating an account on our forum][forum] to provide feedback or ask questions so that we may better assist you and fix your issue(s). You will alos find additional options on the [User Support](https://docs.risenutrition.org/support) page. 

## Components of the Rise Ecosystem

The Rise Nutrition tooling ecosystem is comprised of many different components that
provide a complete insight into you and your team's nutrition and training information.
View the different component overviews below, and please dive into the appropriate component's
documentation as desired.

### Team Admin Dashboard

The [Team Web Dashboard](https://app.risenutrition.org/) is our web-accessible dashboard that
allows team administrators, coaches, medical staff, and registered dietitians to view and manage
all aspects of their team and athletes. This is the main point of interaction for non-athletes to
work with Rise Nutrition data and tooling.

View the [Team Web Dashboard documentation][dashboard] for more information.

### Athlete Mobile Application

The Athlete Mobile Application is our iPhone- and Android-compatible application that
allows athletes to track and monitor their nutrition and training activities. The app is designed to
be simple, informative, and helpful for athletes to understand how to maximize their performance
without getting lost in the weeds.

View the [Athlete Mobile Application documentation][mobile] for more information.

## Adding Your Team to Rise Nutrition

Rise Nutrition is currently in a **[beta-level][beta] release state**, and we are working closely with
our existing partners to build out our initial feature set. If you are interested in participating
through this beta state, please [fill out the contact form][contact], but
know that the platform is not generally-available yet.

We will respond to your request as soon as possible, and if we believe you will be a good fit
for the beta environment, then we will work through the details on an individual case-by-case
basis.

Once the platform is generally available for all teams to join, then this documentation will
be updated to reflect the normal workflow of joining the system.

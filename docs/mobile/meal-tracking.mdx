Tracking your meals via Rise Nutrition gives your coaches and dietitians more
in-depth data points to optimize your performance. The more frequently you track,the more accurate current statistics and future recommendations will be.

## Track Meal

As an athlete, you can add foods for yourself via the mobile app through the following process:

<ImageStepper>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Open Meals"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/image2.jpg"
    imgCaption="From the main screen, tap Meals"
  />
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Select a Meal"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/image4.jpg"
    imgCaption="Select what meal to add an item to"
  >

Tap **+ Add Food** under the meal for which you'd like to add a food item.

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Search"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/image5.jpg"
    imgCaption="Search for the item or meal"
  />
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Select Amount"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/image1.jpg"
    imgCaption="Tap “Add to Meal” once you're sure the food and portion size is correct."
  >

When selected, it will prompt for the _Quantity_ and _Portion Measure_ of the item.
Start by adjusting the portion via the select box, and then update the quantity consumed
of that portion size using the numeric input to the left. Note that the box allows for
partial quantities in cases where only _half_ a measurement was consumed.

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Result"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/image3.jpg"
    imgCaption="The food should now be added under the appropriate meal."
  />


</ImageStepper>


## Set Time

The time will autopopulate with the time food items are being entered. If foods items were not consumed at the time of entry, you can change the time by clicking the time displayed on the listed food item (1) and select the appropriate time (2).

<ImageStepper>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Select Time"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/change time.png"
  >

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Adjust"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/time-adjust.png"
  
  >

  </ImageStepper.Step>
</ImageStepper>



## Mark Meal as Skipped

Any listed meal can easily be marked as skipped by clicking the **Skip** button next to the desired meal.

Note: Marking a meal as skipped simply removes the ability to add any food items on the dashboard or app and makes a log of the action.

<ImageStepper>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Select Skip"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/skip.png"
  >

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Result"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/mobile/meals/tracking/skip-confirm.jpg"
  
  >

  </ImageStepper.Step>
</ImageStepper>

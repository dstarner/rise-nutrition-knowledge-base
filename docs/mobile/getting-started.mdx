# Downloading the Athlete Mobile App

:::info

The Athlete Mobile Application is currently in a **[beta-level][beta] release state**, and we are
working closely with our existing partners to build out our initial feature set. If you are interested
in participating through this beta state, please [reach out to us][contact],
but know that the application is not generally-available yet.

## Downloading for Android

The mobile application is currently only available for iOS during the first phase of the 
[beta-level][beta] release, but we hope to release on Android shortly.

## Downloading for iOS

The mobile application is currently only available via Apple's [TestFlight][testflight]
application and you must be registered with our beta testing group to get access to the
app.

can work with you to see if its possible.

Once we agree to let you join, we will require that you give us **the email associated with your

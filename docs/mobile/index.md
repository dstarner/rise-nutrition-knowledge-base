# Athlete Mobile Application

---

The Athlete Mobile Application is our iPhone- and Android-compatible application that
allows athletes to track and monitor their nutrition and training activities. The app is designed to
be simple, informative, and helpful for athletes to understand how to maximize their performance
without getting lost in the weeds.

The application allows athletes to input critical information that their team dietitians, coaches, and
medical staff can then view on the [Team Web Dashboard][dashboard].

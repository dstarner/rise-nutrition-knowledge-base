### Team Admin Dashboard

The [Team Web Dashboard](https://app.risenutrition.org/) is our web-accessible dashboard that allows team administrators, coaches, medical staff, and registered dietitians to monitor and interact with all their athletes. It is designed to easily switch between teams for those working with an entire athletic department. You'll see that you can add and edit data, view nutrition status and performance metrics for individual athletes and position groups, set goals and reminders, upload educational materials for teams to access and identify trends in nutrition and performance data.

### Athlete Mobile Application

The Athlete Mobile Application is our iPhone- and Android-compatible application that
allows athletes to track and monitor their nutrition and training activities. The app is designed to
be simple, informative, and helpful for athletes to understand how to maximize their performance
without getting lost in the weeds.

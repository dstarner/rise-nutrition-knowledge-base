# Roles & Permissions

**All roles and permissions for Rise Nutrition are associated at the team level**. This means
that if you are an athlete or staff on one team before joining another, your permissions **do not**
copy over. This allows you to hold different roles on different teams, if you find yourself
needing that situation.

## Available Roles

Each team in Rise Nutrition has a few common roles that can be associated with it's members. We
also understand that every team is different though, so we provide the ability to customize roles
and permissions. Please reach out to us if you need any customized authorizations or roles.

By default, each team contains the following roles:

### Athlete

Athletes are users that can be assigned to positions and have access to log into
[the mobile application](/mobile/intro). They have the least amount of permissions in
the system, and what permissions they have are usually limited to their own associated
resources.

At this time, athletes are able to log into the [mobile application](/mobile/intro), but
do not have access to the [team web dashboard](/dashboard/intro).

### Billing Manager

Billing Managers are the team administrators and owners who are responsible for being
contacts with Rise Nutrition for any billing, mailing, or administrative issues that
do not fall under the responsibilities of other roles. Billing managers _may_ be coaches or
members that work with athletes, but they can also be school / team administrators.

They are able to modify roles and invite individuals to the team.

At this time, billing managers are able to log into the [team web dashboard](/dashboard/intro), but
do not have access to the [mobile application](/mobile/intro).

### Coach

Coaches in Rise Nutrition mirror coaches in real life. They have the ability to:

* View athlete, their basic information, and some of their nutritional details
* View & modify athlete positions and assignments
* View & modify training sessions for an athlete or group

At this time, billing managers are able to log into the [team web dashboard](/dashboard/intro), but
do not have access to the [mobile application](/mobile/intro).

## Managing Roles

Currently, only staff can have their permissions changed via the dashboard. If you would like
to make an athlete a staff member, please reach out to our team for assistance.

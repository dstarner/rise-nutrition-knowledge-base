### Assign to a Goal

the goal details page, you can add &amp; remove assignments if you have the appropriate permissions.

Start by selecting the `+ Add Assignment` button which will open up the athlete &amp; position
search dialog.

  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Search for Assignee"

    imgCaption="Search for the desired athlete or position"

In the search bar, start typing the name of an athlete you would like to assign the goal to. If you
would like to assign a position instead, click the icon on the left-side of the search bar to
switch to _position search mode_.

Once selected, the resource will be added on the goal page as an assignment.

# Meal Management

---

**Meals** are used to track what foods an athlete ate, how much, and when the items were
consumed. Each meal then has a comprehensive macro- and micro-nutrient breakdown that provides insight into the consumption habits. 

## Viewing Athlete Meals


On the athlete's profile page you will find a **Meal Information** panel like the one displayed below.  

Note: you can toggle through the dates by clicking the left and right arrows above the panel, or you
can select the date itself which will open up a calendar view to be selected.

Nutrition details and basic breakdown can be found by clicking on the listed meal.

## Tracking a Meal

While you may decide it is up to the athlete in most cases to track their meals, dashboard users and staff members also have the ability to add/edit meals.

On the [athlete's details screen](#viewing-an-athletes-meals), locate the **Meals Panel** that looks
like the image below. Toggle to the date of the skipped meal by clicking the left and right
arrows on the panel, or you can select the date itself which will open up a calendar view to be selected.

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Add the Meal"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/dashboard/meals/AddMealButton.png"
    imgCaption="Select the 'Add' button"
  >

Select the **+** (Add) button on the top of the meal panel to pull up the meal tracking dialog.

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Overview Details"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/dashboard/meals/MealAddOverview.png"
    imgCaption="Provide the variant and time consumed"
  >

Once the dialog is open, it will prompt you for the meal overview details. This includes the variant -
_Breakfast_, _Lunch_, _Dinner_ etc. - and the time consumed. If the meal was skipped, then toggle off
the switch before saving. You can select the _Calendar icon_ for a more user friendly date &amp; time
input.

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Food Details"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/dashboard/meals/MealDetails.png"
    imgCaption="Provide the foods consumed"
  >

Once the overview is provided, you can begin searching for individual food items that were
consumed. Once you select one, it will appear in a list under the search bar. For each item,
you can select the portion size and the quantity consumed of that portion size.

If the portion sizes do not work for your meal case, then you can select the _Beaker Icon_ to
provide a custom portion size that will be used instead.

## Notifying an Athlete to Track a Meal

:::warning

The meal notification feature is still experimental and has some bugs associated with it. We
will polish up this feature at our earliest convenience.

:::

You will most likely be working with many athletes across your organization, which
makes it difficult if you have to manually input their meals for them every time. Rise Nutrition
will automatically ask athletes to track their meals at common intervals, but it is also possible
to notify a user manually to track a meal.

:::info

Note that you can only remind an athlete to track a meal from the current or previous day, in
order to ensure correctness.

notify.

# Meal Management

---

**Meals** are used to track what foods an athlete ate, how much, and when the items were
consumed. Each meal then has a comprehensive macro- and micro-nutrient breakdown that provides insight into the consumption habits. 

## View Athlete Meals


On the athlete's profile page you will find a **Meal Information** panel like the one displayed below.  

Note: you can toggle through the dates by clicking the left and right arrows above the panel, or you
can select the date itself which will open up a calendar view to be selected.

## Track a Meal

While you may decide it is up to the athlete in most cases to track their meals, dashboard users and staff members also have the ability to add/edit meals.

  <ImageStepper>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Track Meal"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/dashboard/meals/Track Meal.png"
    imgCaption="Select the '**+**Track' button"
  >


Select the **+**Track button next to the desired meal on the meal panel to pull up the meal tracking dialog.

</ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Search Meal"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/dashboard/meals/Search Meal.png"
    imgCaption="Search for desired food item"
  >

Key word search your desired food items. Tip: options will include common and branded food items to provide the most accuracy possible. 

  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Edit Quantity"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/dashboard/meals/Edit Quantity.png"
    imgCaption="Change the quantity of food consumed"
  >

For each item, you can select the quantity consumed and portion size.



  </ImageStepper.Step>
  <ImageStepper.Step
    title="Change Time"
    imgSrc="/img/docs/dashboard/meals/Change Time.png"
    imgCaption="Select the time foods were consumed"
  >

The time will autopopulate with the time food items are being entered. If foods items were not consumed at the time of entry, you can change the time by clicking the listed time shown in the top right of the meal box (1) and selected the appropriate time (2). 

  </ImageStepper.Step>
</ImageStepper>

## Mark Meal as Skipped
Any listed meal can easily be marked as skipped by clicking the **+**Track food button next to the desired meal and selecting **Mark as Skipped** in the bottom left of the popup box.

Note: Marking a meal as skipped simply removes the ability to add any food items on the dashboard or app and makes a log of the action. It does not impact calculations for an athlete and can easily be unskipped through a similar process.

## Notify an Athlete to Track a Meal

:::warning

The meal notification feature is still experimental and has some bugs associated with it. We
will polish up this feature at our earliest convenience.

:::

You will most likely be working with many athletes across your organization, which
makes it difficult if you have to manually input their meals for them every time. Rise Nutrition
will automatically ask athletes to track their meals at common intervals, but it is also possible
to notify a user manually to track a meal.

:::info

Note that you can only remind an athlete to track a meal from the current or previous day, in
order to ensure correctness.

# Team Web Dashboard

:::info

The Team Web Dashboard is currently in a **[beta-level][beta] release state**, and we are working closely with
our existing partners to build out our initial feature set. If you are interested in participating
through this beta state, please [reach out to us][contact], but know
that the dashboard is not generally-available yet.

The [Team Web Dashboard](https://app.risenutrition.org/) is our web-accessible dashboard that
allows team administrators, coaches, medical staff, and registered dietitians to view and manage
all aspects of their team and athletes.

TODO: add more here

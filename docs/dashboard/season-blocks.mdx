# Season Blocks

Being a sports team, it is almost inevitable that your team goes through different
periods and seasons of the course of a year. With **off-Season**, **pre-Season**, **in-Season**, and **pot-season** your team is always training and working to improve. The Rise
Nutrition tooling understands this and has support for **Season Block-aware** functionality.

A **Season Block** is a period of time - such as the three aforementioned examples -
that may change how an athlete should train or cater their diet. The team's sport
defines common season block templates that can then be used to designate these block
periods for a single calendar year.

:::note

If a period of time does not have a Season Block assigned to it, then that period is
considered to be the **off-Season** by default. This allows a team to only modify the
_active_ season blocks of their team.

The platform will handle the season changes - including their associated training &
nutrition requirement changes - for you automatically.

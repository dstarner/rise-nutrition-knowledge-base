### Manage Positions

Each athlete can be assigned a primary and secondary position. 
To assign a new position, search for the position in the Position Search box.

</ImageStepper>

To remove a position, simply click the trash icon on the right of the list position. 
Don’t worry if you accidentally remove a position. The action can be undone, by simply clicking the reverse arrow.


The primary position of an athlete is what is used to determine nutrient requirements. To set the primary position, simply check the box to the left desired position below the athlete photo and confirm the selection.
